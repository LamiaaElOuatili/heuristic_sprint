## **Test Instances**

All test instances are located in the folder:  Spd_RF2_20_27_211


Make sure to use the appropriate file from this folder when running the main script.

## **Running the Code**

1. Open `main.py`.  
2. Specify the name of the test file you want to use by editing the corresponding variable in `main.py`. For example:

```python
test_file = "Spd_RF2_20_27_211/test_instance_01.txt"
3. Run the script: python main.py
